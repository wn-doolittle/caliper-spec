# Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification
The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling 
and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, 
analysis and use.

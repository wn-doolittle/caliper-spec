## Abstract

IMS Caliper Analytics&reg; is a technical specification that describes a structured set of vocabulary that assists institutions in collecting learning and usage data from digital resources and learning tools. This data can be used to present information to students, instructors, advisers, and administrators in in order to drive effective decision making to improve learner success.

Caliper can help to answer various questions about learner activity, a few examples questions that Caliper might help answer.

* How often is a learner logging in to view their digital resources?
* Are learners interacting with a forum post?
* How often is a learner consuming course readings or videos?
* What activities is a learner interacting with while taking an assessment?
* Are learners annotating certain digital resources?

With the answers to these questions in tow, decision makers can drive analysis that answers critical questions such as:

* Is there a performance difference between learners who interact with a certain digital resource versus learners who do not?

The sky is the limit with the ways to use Caliper data to measurably improve the learning ecosystem.

## Introduction

### What is this document?

This document is an informative part of the
[Caliper Analytics <sup>&copy;</sup> 1.2 document set](https://www.imsglobal.org/example/v1p1/#document-set).
As such, it may be revised without the specification version being incremented.
Please refer to the [revision history](#revision-history) below for more information
about revisions to this document.

As an informative resource it does not include any normative requirements. Occurrences in this document of terms such as MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD or RECOMMENDED have no impact on the conformance criteria for implementors of this specification.

The primary goal of this document is to lead you to successful implementation of the Caliper Analytics&reg; v1.2 specification. More than that, this guide helps you along the way to achieving conformance certification.

### How to use this document

This document is intended as a starting point for those looking to implement the Caliper Analytics&reg; standard in their educational software ecosystem.

This guide can be used to get a fundamental understanding of the caliper messaging structure, review specific code examples of caliper events, read descriptions of each profile, and as a central hub containing links to conformance requirements and other important resources. The document can also be used as a reference for collated best practices on how to use Caliper in their digital ecosystem and guidance on using Caliper in collaboration with other IMS specifications.  

## Terminology

Learning this vocabulary in the context of the Caliper specification will be very helpful when using this document.  Caliper Analytics describes events using triples, a combination of an *action* being undertaken by an *actor* to an *object*.  A good way to think of it as *someone* (*actor*) did *something* (*action*) to *someone/something* (*object*)

Here are a few useful definitions for terms used throughout this document.  Full Caliper terminology list is available in the [Terminology section of the Caliper Spec](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1.html#terminology).

Here is a short explanation of how Caliper works using this vocabulary. If you can understand this you're well on your way to understanding Caliper!

When a Caliper-observable interaction, as defined by a _Metric Profile_, is detected by a _Sensor_, an _Event_ is created which consists of an _Actor_, an _Object_, and an _Action_. (The Actor did the Action to the Object) To emit an _Event_ to another system via an API call, it is described as a JSON object which is wrapped in an _Envelope_ with a little metadata about the _Sensor_. The JSON is then sent via a secured HTTP call with an authentication token in an HTTP header.

## Conformance Certification

<section id="conformance">
  <h3>Conformance Statements</h3>
</section>

### What is Conformance Certification?
IMS offers a process for testing the conformance of products using the IMS certification test suite. Certification designates passing a set of tests that verify the standard has been implemented correctly and guarantees a product’s interoperability across hundreds of other certified products. The Caliper Analytics Conformance Certification Guide [[CERTGUIDE URL]] provides details about the testing process, requirements, and how to get started.

### What are the benefits of Conformance Certification?
Conformance certification offers more than claims of “compliance,". The only way IMS can guarantee interoperability is by obtaining certification for the latest version of the standard. Only products listed in the official IMS Certified Product Directory can claim conformance certification. IMS certification provides the assurance that a solution will integrate securely and seamlessly into an institution's digital learning ecosystem.

### How does my product get certified?
Certification for Caliper Analytics involves certifying against one or more Metric Profiles.  This means  passing the appropriate tests for the profile or profiles that you are implementing using  the IMS Global suite of Caliper Analytics certification tools.  For more information on the conformance and certification process, please refer to the The Caliper Analytics Conformance Certification Guide [[CERTGUIDE URL]]

## How to create a Caliper Event

### Events

[Link to full Event docs](#events)

An Event is the combination of an *Actor*, an *Action*, and an *Object*. In a sentence, an Event describes what an Actor _did_ (Action) to an Object. Each of those will be described in the following sections.

It's important to have a clear understanding of Caliper Events since they describe the semantics of what's happening in the system.


#### Event Types

Caliper Events each specify which type of event they are.  Events of the same type have several things in common, like required and optional properties.  Some event types include:

[AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent), [AssignableEvent](#assignableEvent), [AssessmentEvent](#assessmentEvent), [AssessmentItemEvent](#assessmentItemEvent), [ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [MediaEvent](#mediaEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [GradeEvent](#gradeEvent), [SessionEvent](#sessionEvent), [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

A full list of event types is available in the Caliper Spec (See "Subtype" subsection of [Event.](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2.html#Event))

#### Event Required Properties

[Link to full Event Properties docs section](#event Properties)


| Property | Type | Description | Disposition |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [UUID](#uuidDef) | A version 4 [UUID](#uuidDef).  The UUID MUST be expressed as a [URN](#urnDef) using the form <code>urn:uuid:<UUID></code> per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122). | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value for the Event Sub Type, or for a generic [Event](#event) set the <code>type</code> to the string value <code>Event</code>. | Required |
| actor | [Agent](#agent) or [IRI](#iriDef) | The [Agent](#agent) who initiated the [Event](#event).  This must be either:  <ul><li>An [Entity](#entity) of the type Agent or one of its subtypes (e.g., Person, SoftwareApplication, etc.).</li><li>A unique [IRI](#iriDef) that represents an [Entity](#entity) as described above.  Ideally this should refer to an [Entity](#entity) previously defined in the payload containing the [Event](#event) or in an eventstore that contains the [Event](#event).| Required |
| action | [Term](#termDef) | The action or predicate that binds the actor or subject to the object.  The <code>action</code> range is limited to the set of [actions](#actions) described in this specification and may be further constrained by the chosen [Event](#event) type.  Only one <code>action</code> [Term](#termDef) may be specified per [Event](#event). | Required |
| object | [Entity](#entity) or [IRI](#iriDef) | The [Entity](#entity) that comprises the object of the interaction.  The <code>object</code> value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the object's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| eventTime | DateTime | An ISO 8601 date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that indicates when the [Event](#event) occurred.  The value MUST be expressed using the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified. | Required |

#### Entity or IRI
Properties with the type "[Entity](#entity) or [IRI](#iriDef)" may be represented as a Caliper entity or an IRI [Internationalized Resource Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier)string.  An IRI may be used to refer to an entity that has been defined earlier, either in the same event, in another event in the same payload, or even in another event in the same eventstore.  The IRI may be a URL, but it's not required.  It could be a URN instead, using the "urn" scheme rather than the "http" or "https" schemes commonly used with URLs.  Often, using a blank node scheme (represented by a single underscore character, "\_") offers flexibility to specify an IRI without the burden of requiring it to resolve to a resource like a URL or to follow specific syntax, like a URN.

#### Other Event Properties

TODO: talk about profiles defining more properties both required and optional.

#### Event JSON stub

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
  "type": "ViewEvent",
  "eventTime": "2018-11-15T10:15:00.000Z",
  "actor": {},
  "action": "",
  "object": {}
}
</code></pre>

### Actors

[Link to full Actor docs](#actors)

In a Caliper Event, the Actor performs the action related to a learning activity. The value of an Event's actor attribute must be an Agent or one of its subtypes — entities which are defined as part of the specification. While often the Actor is a Person, it could also be another Entity type, such as an Organization or SoftwareApplication. Different subtypes of Event further limit what types can be used as the value of the actor property; for example, the actor for a QuestionnaireEvent must be a Person, while the actor for a GradeEvent could be either a Person or a SoftwareApplication (such as an autograder).

For more information, see the [The Information Model](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2.html#infoModel) section of the specification, the description of the [Agent entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2.html#agent), or the full list of [Event subtypes](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2.html#events).


#### Actor JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
  "type": "Person"
}
</code></pre>

### Action

[Link to full Action docs](#actions)

An Action connects an Actor with an Object, helping to describe what learning activity has taken place. Examples include Bookmarked, Launched, OptedIn, and Skipped. Each subtype of Event specifies some number of allowed Actions, while the Event supertype allows any Action declared in the specification. The provided Actions generally take the form of an English verb in past tense and have been connected to one or more word glosses from Princeton University's WordNet or Wiktionary to aid comprehension.

For more information, see the [The Information Model](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2.html#infoModel) section of the specification, or the full list of [supported Actions](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2/caliper-spec-v1p2.html#actions) in the specification document.

#### Action JSON

<pre><code class="json">
"Viewed"
</code></pre>

### Object

[Link to full Object docs](#objects)

TODO: Explain Objects and their basic properties then link to main spec document where appropriate for more details.

#### Object JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/readings/1",
  "type": "DigitalResource",
  "name": "Chapter 1 reading"
}
</code></pre>

### Complete Event Example JSON

To bring it all together, an Event would look something like this:

TODO: Explain how to find sample JSON for their specific event/action/profile by pointing to docs and fixtures, etc. Since we can't put every example in this document, teach how to find examples they need. (This might be worthy of it's own top-level section just for discoverability. Coming to this doc to find example JSON will be one of the primary activities for developers)

#### Complete JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:a2f41f9c-d57d-4400-b3fe-716b9026334e",
  "type": "ViewEvent",
  "eventTime": "2018-11-15T10:16:00.000Z",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "action": "Viewed",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/readings/1",
    "type": "DigitalResource",
    "name": "Chapter 1 reading"
  }
}
</code></pre>

This Event is read as something like: "This Person Viewed this DigitalResource at this eventTime"

#### Smaller, ID-Only JSON

TODO: Short explanation about using ID only (or "Type Coercion") instead of full object and then _link_ to more in-depth explanations around proper use. Maybe make a best practice section about when you should generally use object vs just ID and how it needs to be agreed upon between the parties so that they remain interoperable?

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:a2f41f9c-d57d-4400-b3fe-716b9026334e",
  "type": "ForumEvent",
  "eventTime": "2018-11-15T10:16:00.000Z",
  "actor": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
  "action": "Subscribed",
  "object": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/forums/1"
}
</code></pre>

### Additional properties on Events

While the base information required by most Events is represented in the above example, each Event type could require more properties, and allow for more properties and context as desired by the implementors. To understand what information is required and possible you should consult the Metric Profiles for the activities you're trying to implement.

## Metric Profiles

The Caliper information model defines a number of profiles, each of which models a learning activity or a supporting activity that helps facilitate learning. A profile's raison d'etre is to encourage vocabulary standardization and re-use among application providers delivering complementary, albeit competing capabilities that collect learning activity data. Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner using a shared vocabulary. Annotating a reading, playing a video, taking a test, or grading an assignment submission represent a few examples of the many activities or events that Caliper's profiles attempt to describe.

Think of each profile as a stand-alone, logical container, or collection of one or more Caliper events that together help describe a set of interrelated activities.

TODO: Table with all profiles and links to their documentations and their certification requirements in the certification guide

### How do I use profiles to deliver insight?

A great way to think of a Metric Profile is by the questions it can help answer. For example the Reading Profile could help Instructors and researchers answer questions such as:

 - Who is consuming the content?
 - What materials are being accessed?
 - When are the resources accessed?
 - How often is the content viewed?
 - What paths are taken to reach the content?

Profiles also serve as the unit of certification for the Caliper Analytics&reg; standard allowing implementers to build to the events and actions that they require to answer the digital learning ecosystem questions that are relevant to their organization.  Caliper Analytics&reg; does provide a mechanism for updates and additions as  profile extensions can be published between major releases of the specification.  For more details see the [Release expectations](#release-expectations) section.

TODO: Talk about how <code>@context</code> changes for extensions and explain how it works? Then point to the Release Schedule section.

## Custom Extensions

TODO: how to do this. Don't know where best to put this section. Might be mostly pointing to other JSON-LD resources.


## Sending an Event to an endpoint

### Envelopes

Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) data MUST be transmitted inside a Caliper [Envelope](#envelope), a purpose-built JSON data structure that includes metadata about the emitting [Sensor](#sensor) and the data payload.

A Caliper envelope must contain the <code>sensor</code>,
<code>sendTime</code>, <code>dataVersion</code> and <code>data</code> properties.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  No custom properties are permitted.

#### Base Envelope JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "sensor": "https://example.edu/sensors/1",
  "sendTime": "2018-11-15T11:05:01.000Z",
  "dataVersion": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "data": [ {event1}, {event2}, {eventN}]
}
</code></pre>

#### Envelope with an Event JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "sensor": "https://example.edu/sensors/1",
  "sendTime": "2018-11-15T11:05:01.000Z",
  "dataVersion": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "data": [{

    },
    "action": "Used",
    "object": {
      "id": "https://example.edu",
      "type": "SoftwareApplication"
    }
  }]
}
</code></pre>

#### Mixed payload Envelope JSON

In this example, the Person and SoftwareApplication are part of the data array and referenced from the events for reuse.

### Sending to a secured HTTP endpoint

TODO: Short description of how it's done then link to the LTI service definition: https://github.com/IMSGlobal/LTI-spec-Caliper/blob/develop/lti-spec-caliper.md#23-communicating-the-availability-of-the-service

TODO: Also explain how 2 vendors can work out keys and endpoints independent of LTI.


## Receiving Caliper Events

TODO: Talk about LRS/LRW? Talk about validating events and doing something with them right away vs throwing into a bucket super fast for later analysis?

TODO: Talk about auth header check

TODO: Talk about credentials? Or just reference the LTI doc again?


### What implementation considerations exist for Caliper Consumers?
Several implementation considerations exist for Caliper Consumers.  Typically, these consumers play a role during the initial ingestion portion of an overall data “pipeline”.  In such a pipeline, raw source data is emitted or generated, then ingested into a Data “Lake”.  A Data Lake is a storage repository than can store large amounts of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data.  Ultimately, the benefit of a data lake approach is to enable flexibility, providing a place for data to be gathered from multiple sources in a variety of formats.

The following best practices are typically recommended for data pipeline components that process Caliper data:

- **Use Cheap Storage to Preserve Raw Event Messages.** Many Caliper consumers use cheap storage buckets in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage to preserve raw event messages.  Storage components such as AWS S3 can support annotation with metadata for cataloging purposes, and integrates with other AWS services such as AWS Glue, Lambda and Kinesis that will serve as components of the data lake.  
- **Take Advantage of Stream Processing Components.**  Cloud infrastructure components such as AWS Kinesis Firehose are useful for bundling groups of Caliper messages arriving at the same time into JSON files, which are then kept in folders organized by year/month/day/hour.  In addition, components such as AWS Kinesis Analytics can be used to keep running totals or to detect anomalies in event streams.
- **Set Up Ingest Processes With Known Mapping and Transform Rules.**  Examples of tasks which may need to be performed with inbound Caliper data are as follows:
  - Identify and locate common identifiers across the incoming data records.
  - Identify mappings between similar but differently named data fields and define logic for any transformations (parsing out specific identifiers from string fields, for example).
  - Determine how to handle display fields that contain strings that might be too long or have unsupported characters  
  - Some data records may not contain an identifier that can be used to commonly join them across sources.  In those cases, you will need to maintain a set of mapping tables with locally-sourced identifiers and their mappings to global identifiers.  
  - This may mean that you need to manufacture a global set of identifiers to unify the data across systems.
  - Coordinate and communicate with any departments/groups who own or can help locate the “source of truth” for identifiers.
- **Don’t Forget About Reference Data.** Set up processes to bring in reference data (users, departments, calendar events, work project names).



## Release Schedule Expectations

- Core specification to be released at most once a year
  - new base context is updated

- Profiles can be extended during year
 - profile is described in core
 - and might be extensions
 - manifested in JSON as a different @context string by adding <code>-extension</code>

- Talk about how upgrades happen for both sides. Should receiver of events try to understand all previous versions of a profile? Explain everything needed to understand the scope of implementing upgraded core versions and profiles.

## Use Cases

### Value Statement

 As the online educational ecosystem grows, it becomes increasingly important to be able to measure the efficacy of tools and programs with the ultimate goal of improving learner successes.  To that end, the industry has embraced the need for "Big Data" analytics to drive insight.  Caliper Analytics&reg; structured, standards based approach provides a strong foundation for both providers and consumers of learning analytics data to make better decisions based off of a shared curated vocabulary. Caliper Analytics&reg; provides the necessary alignment and structure to what is and should be measured, along with a framework to support the capture and marshaling of data,

### Understanding learner interactions across vendor tools

An instructor, seeking to augment the classroom environment for her learners, utilizes a video platform to create and post video assignments. Class discussions and Q&A sessions are conducted online using another service and she administers her course using a learning management system. These three services are provided by three vendors, three potential sources of learning data. Analyzing the interaction behaviors of her students in relation to the questions they pose about her course content is vital to understanding student comprehension and performance. Caliper allows the collection of learning data and addresses important issues such as who owns the data, managing privacy requirements, and bringing together data from diverse systems to analyze.

### Understanding licensed value

Using the same Caliper data being collected at the course level in the prior scenario, but at the cohort or system level, can be leveraged to determine in aggregate how much usage a licensed tool is getting across a cohort or within a segment of students. This data could be used to determine when it is safe to perform upgrades when it is time to begin migration planning or other operational concerns with various learning tools

### Profile Use Cases

Caliper Metric profiles represent foundational usage cases.  Each Metric Profile has it's own subset of use cases listed in it's primary specification document as linked to in this document.

- TODO: Find some demonstrative use cases and explain how they'd be solved by talking through what questions they want answered, then what Metric Profiles and Events are needed to answer them.

Make sure to get a use case that decides why and how to add custom extensions.

Need to add use cases for all action types for each profile ( request from issue #196)

### Best Practices

Below are some of the collected best practices from members who have successfully implemented the Caliper Analytics&reg; standard.

### Tool Provider perspective LTI launch.
- Tool Providers should use the federated session ID as the <code>id</code> of the federatedSession entity you include in events
- Tool Providers should pick out the system identifiers from the LTI message that are relevant to you as a Tool, and put them in as <code>SystemIdentifiers</code> on the _entities_ in your events that are relevant. This helps
  - Bind identifiers to the items they belong to, and not to the _session_
  - Helps data consumers easily find those properties rather than having to dig through a big bag of<code>Event.federatedSession.messageProperties</code>keys.

With some platforms the identifier might be the "user's login session"; in other platforms, it might be "just the individual launch".

Receivers of events should/could expect that they'd get single def'ns of dimensional data to keep the event stream lean -- like an endpoint could get raw Entity "describes" in the event stream, or they might get a full object for a User at the "beginning" of a report of 100s of events of activity, and then only the Person's "id" IRI in the following events...

### Sending full objects vs just the ID/IRI

TODO: We should probably suggest in the implementation guide that receivers of events should|could expect that they'd get single def'ns of dimensional data to keep the event stream lean -- like an endpoint could get raw Entity "describes" in the event stream, or they might get a full object for a User at the "beginning" of a report of 100s of events of activity, and then only the Person's "id" IRI in the following events...

TODO: This should be merged with the next item in list

### Deciding what and how much data to send in events

- Data generated by the app which would otherwise be lost (i.e. not persisted) is a good candidate to convey in a Caliper event.
- Data that is readily accessible via dereferenceble IRI's, it is OK to include just the IRI's.
- If there are cases where downstream processes would need quick access to the actual generated data, it is ok to include those data values as well.
- It can be good to only emit what you generate: in other words, if your application has to do any extra work to retrieve related information, it's not recommended to include it in the event payload.


### LTI Sessions and Identifiers

TODO: Link to the "Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI) Caliper Analytics® Endpoint Service Specification, version 1.0" spec when it's published somewhere.

#### Federated session ID

TODO: Link to the official spec section for this when it exists: https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-spec/blob/develop/caliper-spec.md#ltiSession

When receiving an LTI Launch use the <code>caliper_federated_session_id</code> as the <code>id</code> of the <code>LtiSession</code> you include in events:

<pre><code class="json">
 {
   "id": "urn:uuid:1c519ff7-3dfa-4764-be48-d2fb35a2925a",
   "type": "LtiSession"
 }
</code></pre>

You add it to an event using the <code>federatedSession</code> key:

<pre><code class="json">
 {
   "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
   "id": "urn:uuid:9r34jdfj-a0d8-4430-95bd-783ffae4d916",
   "type": "ToolUseEvent",
   "eventTime": "2018-11-15T11:15:00.000Z",
   "actor": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
   "action": "Used",
   "object": "https://example.edu",
   "federatedSession": {
     "id": "urn:uuid:1c519ff7-3dfa-4764-be48-d2fb35a2925a",
     "type": "LtiSession"
   }
 }
</code></pre>

#### Other IDs and launch information

There is a lot of other information that can be passed along with an LTI Launch. Here are some guidelines to consider when deciding what information to include with your Caliper events:

- pick out the system identifiers from the LTI message that are relevant to you as a Tool, and put them in as SystemIdentifiers on the _entities_ in your events that are relevant.
 - This helps (a) bind those identifiers to the things they belong to, and not to the "session", and
 - (b) helps data consumers easily find those properties rather than having to dig through a big bag of<code>Event.federatedSession.messageProperties</code>keys.
 - TODO: Link to the area of the spec for how to add other identifiers to objects
 - Any identifiers generated by your app should be represented as first class properties in the Caliper event; however any identifiers which were passed into your application (say as LTI launch parameters) should be included as federatedSession properties.

You might want to capture the <code>messageParameters</code> from an LTI launch message and include those in the federated session property, but the message bodies are quite large, and you should prefer to rely in the federated session ID to retrieve any needed information unless you have a specific purpose for including all that information.

Here is an example of adding extra LTI information into the <code>LtiSession</code> object:

<pre><code class="json">
{
   "id": "urn:uuid:1c519ff7-3dfa-4764-be48-d2fb35a2925a",
   "type": "LtiSession",
   "user": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
   "messageParameters": {
     "lti_message_type": "basic-lti-launch-request",
     "lti_version": "LTI-2p0",

### Robustness expectations

As an _analytics_ specification, Caliper is not generally well suited to other uses that require more robust guarantees around timeliness and completeness.  A few items of consideration are listed below.

- Caliper is _not_ specified as a messaging or transaction service
- There are no guarantees around delivery timing
- Events in Caliper are _not_ ordered and may come much later, or in batches, etc.
- If two vendors need plan to use events as transaction they should work that out in their vendor agreements
- Other reasons why it might not be a good idea to rely on Caliper for user-facing production problems.
- Do _not_ rely on it for grades! Use: list other standards & services?
_ Do not rely on it for course and enrollment information. Use: list other standards & services?


### Industry Analytics and Data Retention Standards

TODO: Explain and link to industry best practices around ethics, data retention best practices and laws, and other stuff? I assume there are some good resources out there for researchers and IRB training.


### JSON-LD

[JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/2018/jsonld-cg-reports/json-ld/) is a specification providing a JSON-based data serialization and messaging format, processing algorithms and API for working with Linked Data. The messages described in this specification are intended to be used in programming environments that support JSON-LD

TODO: How Caliper uses JSON-LD and links to Caliper docs for further learning if necessary


## Working with other IMS Specifications

As an analytics standard, Caliper is relevant to almost every other IMS specification in some way. These sections will cover some of ways Caliper interacts with other specifications.


### CASE - Competencies and Academic Standards Exchange

[CASE](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/case) is used to align learning content and activities with academic standards. It might be useful to pass the CASE standard a Caliper <code>Entity</code> is aligned with via a [LearningObjective](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1.html#learningObjective) <code>Entity</code> included with the <code>Object</code> in a Caliper <code>Event</code>.

Researchers and analytics who collect data aligned to learning objectives can use it to correlate between learning activities and academic standards.

Wherever CASE-aligned learning objectives are associated to [DigitalResources] you may want to include them in the <code>learningObjectives</code> array on your resource. 

If the Caliper endpoint is able to retrieve this information from another source then it may be better to not include the <code>LearningObjective</code> to help keep the Caliper Event's JSON smaller.

Here is an example of a CASE <code>LearningObjective</code> with a full object (<code>name</code> and<code>description</code> are optional)

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/assign/2",
  "type": "AssignableDigitalResource",
  "name": "Reading Assignment: Research techniques",
  "learningObjectives": [
    {
      "id": "https://case.georgiastandards.org/ims/case/v1p0/CFItems/2f5e8130-46fa-11e7-b197-cd3432e719f9",
      "type": "LearningObjective",
      "name": "Research techniques",
      "description": "ELAGSE1RL1 Ask and answer questions about key details in a text."
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

For brevity, it also valid to just include the <code>id</code> in the <code>learningObjectives</code> array like this:

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/assign/2",
  "type": "AssignableDigitalResource",
  "name": "Reading Assignment: Research techniques",
  "learningObjectives": [
    "https://case.georgiastandards.org/ims/case/v1p0/CFItems/2f5e8130-46fa-11e7-b197-cd3432e719f9",
    "https://case.georgiastandards.org/ims/case/v1p0/CFItems/2f5eda0e-46fa-11e7-b90a-62096a00843f"
  ]
}
</code></pre>


### LTI - Learning Tools Interoperability

TODO: overview paragraph about caliper/lti?

#### How does an LTI Tool know where to send Caliper events?

An LTI Tool can use the [LTI Caliper Connector](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/LTI-spec-Caliper/blob/master/docs/lti-spec-caliper.md) service to retrieve a Caliper endpoint to send events to and get an authorization token from.

This service also specifies that the<code>Caliper.sessionId</code>value should be sent on an LTI launch. This is what Caliper calls the "Federated Session ID" as described in the [LTI Sessions and Identifiers](#lti-sessions-and-identifiers) section.


#### How can I track how much LTI tools are used and privacy issues around them?

For the institutions that heavily use LTI tools they often want to know how much a tool is used, and what information about the student and class is being sent to 3rd party vendors. There are 2 [Caliper Profiles] that help make this information available to faculty and administrators.

##### Tool Launch Profile & LTI Insights

The [Tool Use](#) and [Tool Launch](#) profiles are meant to help understand how LTI tools are used at an institution. Their use is highly recommended for all LTI tools.

##### Tool Use Profile


### OneRoster & LIS

Something about IDs for users/contexts?
IDs could be in LIS vocabulary, and you can read about that in the [LIS Documentation]. 

TODO: How would a system commonly fetch correlated information from a OneRoster, LIS, SIS system?


### OpenVideo

The Media Profile should be used by platforms implementing [OpenVideo](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/openvideo).


### QTI - Question and Test Interoperability

For a learner's interactions within a [QTI](https://www.imsglobal.org/question/index.html) assessment the [Assessment Profile](#) should be used. This profile is useful for all assessments whether driven by QTI or not allowing researchers and tool creators to send events about assessment generically.  

For more research on detailed assessment interactions as supported by QTI the [QTI Profile](#) can be used.

It is recommended that these two profiles are used together depending on the needs of the ongoing research or learning application.


### Unique ID Taskforce thing?

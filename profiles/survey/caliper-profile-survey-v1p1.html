  <h2>Abstract</h2>  This document extends Caliper 1.1 by providing a vocabulary for describing a survey respondent's
  interactions with questionnaires and individual question items. A key use case involves instrumenting
  platforms that provide online surveys that explore the student learning experience, student engagement,
  learning activities, learning progress, and learning performance. It is known that time spent on online learning
  activities does not necessarily indicate whether or not the learner finds the materials easy or hard, interesting
  or boring, useful or not. Leaner feedback is a key source of data that can help glean insights into student learning
  styles and interests, as well as areas to improve.  Collecting and analyzing learner feedback data is thus critical
  to enhancing our understanding of learning patterns and behavior.

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <section class="informative">
    <h3>Design Goals and Rationale</h3>

    <img height="100%" width="100%" src="./assets/caliper-profile_survey.png" alt="Survey Profile"/>

    <p>The Caliper survey profile provides a vocabulary for describing events associated with a respondent's
      participation in online surveys. A key use case involves instrumenting platforms that provide online surveys
      that explore the student learning experience, student engagement, learning activities, learning progress,
      and learning performance. The profile models a <code>Person</code>, typically a respondent or a rater,
      participating in a survey in order to provide feedback on their learning and academic experiences. </p>

    <p>Everyone learns differently with a mix of their own learning styles. It is also known that a student’s
      time spent on online learning activities does not necessarily indicate that the
      student finds the materials easy or hard, interesting or boring, useful or not to their learning.
      Student feedback is a key source of data that can help glean insights into students’ learning styles and
      interests, as well as areas to improve. In that sense, student feedback data adds an additional dimension
      of students’ behavioral data for learning analytics such as learning about student perceptions of how
      effectively learning activities helped student learning and what specific areas in teaching and learning
      can be improved to enhance students’ learning experience and learning performance. The Caliper survey
      Profile expands the pool of Caliper-instrumented learning data profiles to enhance the learning analytics
      across the analytics continuum – descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive, by allowing to
      incorporate student voices to make learning analytics more robust.</p>

  <section class="informative" id="usecases">
    <h3>Use cases</h3>
    <p>The Survey Profile supports the following use cases:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>1. <strong>Analytics for student engagement</strong>: Student feedback survey participation behavioral
          data is an input to the student engagement modeling (description, predictive, and prescription)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. <strong>Analytics for predicting student retention and success</strong>: Student feedback on their
          learning experience is an input to predictive modeling of student retention and student success,
          combined with other data such as LMS behavioral data, demographics, learning performance </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. <strong>Analytics for instructional designs and learning strategies</strong>: Student feedback
          data is an input to personalized learning and adaptive learning that incorporates student feedback,
          determining efficacy of particular learning interventions and learning strategies.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. <strong>Analytics for identifying areas to improve</strong> teaching and learning effectiveness,
          validating the pertinent KPIs to measure progress, and prescribing potential corrective interventions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5. <strong>Analytics for workload</strong> Measuring student workload is essential for optimizing
          learning, and workload research is under development. Various studies observed the gap between what
          logs (click behaviors) say and what students say (survey) about workload, which need a deeper
          understanding to predict or prescribe optimal workload that contributes to optimize learning </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6. <strong>Analytics for monitoring and improving response rates</strong>: getting a sufficient
          number of feedback responses is a critical part of reliability and validity of results for data-driven,
          informed decision making. A low response rate may decrease the statistical power of the data collected
          and undermine the reliability of the results.</td>

    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <p>The Survey profile introduces 4 terms into the Caliper space.</p>

    <p><strong>Survey</strong>: A Survey is the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing the responses
      from the questions in a questionnaire. During their college/university days, students can invited to
      various types of survey to provide their voice such as formative feedback, course evaluations, graduate
      exit surveys, alum surveys, library services survey, etc. Raters will be invited to participate in a survey.
      Then, raters can opt out or opt in, depending on how the survey is set up. Raters can be reminded to
      participate after the first invitation, in an effort to improve the response rates, as a low response rate
      may decrease the statistical power of the data collected and undermine the validity of the results. </p>

    <p><strong>Questionnaire</strong>: a survey questionnaire is a set of
      feedback questions that raters will respond to in a particular survey.</p>

    <p><strong>Questionnaire Item</strong>: a survey questionnaire item consists of a feedback
      question included in a survey questionnaire and a rater’s response. There are various types of
      survey questions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Closed-ended feedback questions: predefined responses are given so that respondents can
        choose their responses from the predefined responses.
        <ul>
          <li>Rating scale question in a rating scale (e.g., Likert-type scales, semantic differential scales),</li>
          <li>Multiple choice questions asking to choose between two or more response options.</li>
          <li>Rank order questions requiring the respondent to rate a set of alternatives.</li>
          <li>Numeric questions</li>
          <li>Date questions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Open-ended feedback questions: ask respondents to supply their own responses in the form of qualitative
        feedback, otherwise known as natural language or unstructured data.
        No predefined responses are given, so respondents are free to record their responses without length limits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Survey Invitation</strong>: an invitation to participate in a survey that is sent out to
      raters (such as students) </p>

    <p>All terminology used in this specification is concordant with the term
      definitions in the Caliper 1.1 Specification [[!CALIPER-11]].</p>

  <h2>Caliper JSON-LD Examples</h2>

  <p>Individual Caliper events and entity describes are serialized as JSON-LD. IMS Global
    provides a remote Survey Profile JSON-LD <a href=
      "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1/SurveyProfile-extension">context</a> for mapping
    <code>SurveyEvent</code>, <code>SurveyInvitationEvent</code>, <code>QuestionnaireEvent</code>,
    <code>QuestionnaireItemEvent</code>, <code>NavigationEvent</code>, and <code>ViewEvent</code> terms to IRIs.
    Caliper message producers MUST reference the Survey Profile 1.1-extension context in every <code>Event</code>
    subtype described in this profile. Likewise, Caliper message producers MUST reference the Survey
    Profile 1.1-extension context whenever an <code>Entity</code> subtype described in this profile is emitted on
    its own as a <em>describe</em>.</p>

  <p>See the Caliper 1.1 specification [[!CALIPER-11]] for a discussion of JSON-LD and JSON-LD
